Empower your writing process
============================

This repository contains my slides for a 45-min talk about my thesis
writing process. This talk is included in the EPFL seminar `Empower
your writing process <http://library2.epfl.ch/page-55486.html>`_,
which takes place at EPFL, on September 3rd 2015.

The current version of the slides can be accessed `here
